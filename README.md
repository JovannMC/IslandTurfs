# IslandTurfs

An (incomplete) custom plugin made for Protocraft recreating the IslandTurfs minigame as a Spigot plugin

## Description

This is a 1.19.3 Spigot plugin that was custom made for a friend's server, Protocraft, recreating the server's IslandTurfs minigame as a Spigot plugin to be easier to maintain and move from pure vanilla command blocks.<br>
I am not working on this and the server anymore, and decided to open source the plugin to add on to my portfolio.<br>
**Don't expect great code and practices.**
